# RGCHASER

Continuously updating...

We have created an open-source tool called RGCHASER, which can help you complete fuzzing and mutation testing tasks more conveniently and efficiently. We have compressed the source code into a zip file. All you need to do is download the file, unzip it, and you will find a file named interface.py inside. This file is the main program of the tool, and you can run it to start the tool. We have uploaded the zip file to GitHub, and you can find it at this link: https://github.com/Yuteng-Lu/RGCHASER. If you are interested in our tool, please feel free to download and try it out. You can provide feedback via email at luyuteng@pku.edu.cn.

Our open-source tool is a software that can help users analyze and process image data, offering various functions, one of which is the ability to generate diagnostically capable images. These images can be used to detect problems within neural networks. Our tool assists users in automatically generating and filtering these images based on their needs. We have decided to share some of the images we generated online. These images are generated based on the publicly available MNIST dataset, without involving any private or sensitive information.

Our goal is to use RGCHASER to generate diagnostic images that help neural network users identify potential issues. Oscillating Loss is a phenomenon that occurs during the training process of convolutional neural networks, characterized by non-converging fluctuations in the loss function, which affects the performance and stability of the model. Our images are sensitive to neural networks with Oscillating Loss issues. After making the generated images open-source, they can be used by others. We have placed them in the zip file mentioned above (Diagnostic images.zip). Additionally, we have only made images for Oscillating Loss issues open-source for now. Please look forward to other image sets in the future.
